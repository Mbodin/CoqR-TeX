  abstract = {This paper reports on the development and formal verification (proof
of semantic preservation) of \CompCert{}, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the \Cn{} programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the \coqn{} proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}
