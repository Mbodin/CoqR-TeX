\begin{abstract}
Real-world programming languages have subtle behaviours.
In particular, their semantics is often associated with
various corner cases.
Programmers are sometimes unaware of all these corner cases,
which can yield to serious bugs.
This is an opportunity for our community
as \Coq{} provides a way to certify the behaviour of a program.
But if the certified program is not written in \Coq{},
such a certification relies on a formal semantics of its programming language.
In the case of a real-world language, such a semantics
can be as difficult to trust as the original program.
Some previous work proposed ways to trust such large semantics.
This work evaluates the feasibility of such a large-scale formalisation
in the case of the \R{} programming language---%
a trending programming language specialised in statistics.
We introduce a formalisation of the core of \R{}
related to the reference \R{} interpreter.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\R{}~\parencite{ihaka1996r, Rwebsite} is a trending
programming language for statisticians.
It has a large range of usages (biology, finance, etc.),
as illustrated by the list of available packages categories
available at
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/}.
As a consequence of this diversity,
\R{} programmers come from very different fields of study,
resulting in largely different programming styles.
This makes \R{} unlikely to disappear
in the following years.

The \R{} programming language presents itself
as an expressive and powerful language,
able to express complex notions in few keystrokes.
This sometimes come with the cost of readability.
% it can be difficult to fully understand what a given \R{} program exactly does.
The semantics of \R{} is subtle
and contains numerous corner cases,
as shown in Section~\ref{sec:presentation}.
%
As a consequence, bugs can be frequent in \R{} programs
(as illustrated by the existence of various debugging tools~\parencite{mcpherson2014}),
and trusting such programs can be difficult.
Formal methods in general and the \Coq{} proof assistant in particular
offer an interesting answer to this trust issue.
But to formally prove that an \R{} program meets its specification,
we need a semantics for \R{}.
% Such a semantics needs to be trustworthy.
% In particular, it should capture all the corner cases
% with which a proven program can cope.

A semantics for the full \R{} language will inevitably
be complex, as all corner cases has to be taken into account.
% The question of trusting such a semantics
% then naturally arises.
%
To be able to trust such a formalisation,
it is important to identify \emph{trust sources}.
These can be language specifications,
test suites,
or reference interpreters.
%
% When formalising a complex programming language such as \R{},
Defining the formal model itself
is actually a relatively small part of the formalisation process,
given how difficult it can be to convince non-\Coq{} users
that they can trust our formalisation~\parencite{leroy2014pip}.

% Specifications are the preferred trust source.
% They provide a non-ambigous description of the language constructs's behaviours.
% A formalisation can be related by similarity:
% its constructs and operations should mimic the ones
% of the specification.
% Ideally, such a similarity would be a line-to-line closeness,
% each line of the formalisation referring to a line of the specification,
% and conversely.

% Test suites provide a large number of programs and their expected result.
% When the formalisation is executable, it can be tested against such tests suites.
% This technique then enables to evaluate the quality of the test suite
% using its code coverage.

% Reference interpreters are particularly interesting as
% they can be used similarly to either specifications or test suites.
% It is indeed possible to relate a formal semantics
% to the source code of the reference interpreter,
% using it as a specification.
% But it is also possible to compare the results of the reference interpreter
% and the formal semantics (if executable) on random programs,
% until the wanted code coverage is reached.

In the case of \R{}, there is unfortunately
no precise language specification.
There are however some test suites~\parencite{2014testr, maj2013testr},
as well as a reference interpreter~\parencite{Rwebsite},
from which alternative implementations of \R{} are related.
%
Our formalisation can thus be written in a similar
way than the source code of the reference interpreter,
as well as being executable to be able to run it on test suites.
We believe that these two relation methods are enough
to convince anyone that we closely capture all of \R{} behaviours.

The \R{} language is large,
but it contains a core which is both small and easy to identify.
We introduce a full \Coq{} specification for this core.
The formalisation presents itself as a monadic interpreter.
This interpreter mimics the operations of the reference interpreter,
using its \Cn{} source code as a specification.
%
Section~\ref{sec:presentation} presents some of the subtleties of the \R{} programming language.
Then Section~\ref{sec:formalisation} presents how our formalisation is defined,
and in particular, how it is related to the \R{} source code.

\section{Presentation of \R{} and its Core}
\label{sec:presentation}

\R{} is a weakly typed programming language.
Its basic data types mainly consist of various kinds of arrays.
It was originally defined a variant of Scheme
which has been mutated in order to look like its predecessor,
the S programming language~\parencite{ihaka1996r}.
This construction has several implications.
First, functions are first class in \R{}.
Second, \R{} follows the code-is-data paradigm:
it is possible to delay the evaluation of statements,
and even to manipulate their inner structure
(for instance using the \mintinline{R}{substitute} \R{} function).

Almost all constructs of \R{} are treated as functions.
This includes features like \mintinline{R}{if}, \mintinline{R}{while},
and assignments.
\R{} source code contains a table,
the \emph{symbol table},
associating each construct to a \Cn{} function.
Some of these functions (\mintinline{R}{if}, assignments, etc.)
are special and directly manipulate the abstract syntax tree
of their arguments.
% The other \Cn{} functions are called after the evaluation of the arguments,
% and thus receive a basic type of the language.
%
In this work,
we consider that the features of this table
are \emph{not} part of the core of \R{}.
In other words, we define the core of \R{}
as the parts of \R{} needed to access this table
and execute its \Cn{} functions.

This definition of \R{}'s core enables us to focus
our formalisation effort on a very restricted part of the language.
It includes the rules for function calls,
environments, closures, promises (delayed evaluation), \R{} internals,
as well as the parts initialising the symbol table.
Constructs like \mintinline{R}{if} and \mintinline{R}{while}
are not part of the core,
but (some kinds of) assignments are,
as they are used during function calls.

We now present some corner cases in the \R{} semantics.
Most \R{} constructs
% adapt themselves when given unusual arguments to,
try, in some ways, to ``guess'' what the programmer meant.
% For instance, the \mintinline{R}{i:j} construct
% builds a numerical array from the values \mintinline{R}{i}
% to \mintinline{R}{j}, which can be any expression.
% For instance \mintinline{R}{1:3} is the array containing
% the values \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\).
% But if the second argument if less than the first argument,
% \R{} builds a decreasing array instead of an empty one.
% This is a frequent bug pattern when such an expression is involved in a loop.
The same syntactic construct can thus be associated
with different behaviours.
For instance, array look-up is written \mintinline{R}{a[i]}:
if the variable \mintinline{R}{i} evaluates to an array of indices
(a number is considered to be an array of size \(1\)),
then \mintinline{R}{a[i]} returns an array with
the corresponding elements of \mintinline{R}{a} in order.
But if \mintinline{R}{i} evaluates to an array of negative integers,
then the array \mintinline{R}{a} is copied,
and all elements whose (opposite) index is in the array \mintinline{R}{i}
are removed.
% For instance, \mintinline{R}{a[-3]} is the same as the array \mintinline{R}{a},
% but without its third element
% (the later elements being moved by one index).
Other behaviours are also defined when \mintinline{R}{i}
evaluates to a boolean array or a string array.
Consequently,
as \R{} is untyped,
a simple function like \mintinline{R}{function (a, i) a[i]}
is already complex to fully specify.

Another source of subtlety of \R{} is that it lazily evaluates expressions,
including those with side effects.
The following function \mintinline{R}{f} illustrates this effect:
it only evaluates its second argument if the first is \(1\).
Thus, in its second call, the variable \mintinline{R}{b}
has confusingly not been defined because the assignment \mintinline{R}{b <- 1}
was not evaluated.
\begin{minted}{R}
f <- function (x, y) if (x == 1) y
f (1, a <- 1); a # Returns 1.
f (0, b <- 1); b # Raises an error.
\end{minted}

\R{} contains a large number of such semantic exceptions.
None of these corner cases are inherently complex to deal with,
but the large amount of such cases makes the language complex.


\section{Formalisation}
\label{sec:formalisation}

Our formal semantics is related to the \Cn{} source code
of the \R{} reference interpreter
by a line-to-line correspondance:
every one or two lines of our semantics
correspond to one or two lines of the reference interpreter.
Our formal semantics is presented as a monadic interpreter in \Coq{}.
This interpreter is runnable,
which unables us to test our semantics against
\R{} test suites in future work.
However, as the core of \R{} is very limited,
non-core features will have to be added for testing.
These features can be added following the same methodology than the one presented here.
Figure~\ref{fig:coq} shows our \Coq{} translation
of the \Cn{} function shown in Figure~\ref{fig:c}.

We used monads very similar to the ones of JSRef~\parencite{popl14jscert}:
a \mintinline{Coq}{result} is either a success---%
it then transports the actual result and the resulting state
\mintinline{Coq}{S} of the program---,
an error, or \mintinline{Coq}{result_bottom}---%
meaning that the interpreter ran out of fuel during the execution.
These monads enable us to abstract most of the aspects
of imperativity and memory handling from \Cn{}.
Examples of monads includes
\mintinline{Coq}|let%success|,
to extract the result given by a function
(it exactly corresponds to the monadic \emph{bind} operator),
or \mintinline{Coq}|read%defined|, to read the content of a pointer.
\Coq{} notations have heavily been used
for the line-to-line correspondance.
For instance, let us consider
the line \mintinline{C}{if (rho->type != ENVSXP)}
of Figure~\ref{fig:c}.
It has been translated into two lines:
a monad \mintinline{Coq}|read%defined|
first dereferences the pointer \mintinline{C}{rho}
(which may fail if the pointer is unbound),
then the test is performed.
Every line has been similarly translated.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}{C}
SEXP applyClosure (SEXP op, SEXP arglist, SEXP rho){
  SEXP formals, actuals, savedrho, newrho, res;
  if (rho->type != ENVSXP)
    error ("'rho' must be an environment.");
  formals = op->clo.formals;
  savedrho = op->clo.env;
  PROTECT (actuals = matchArgs (formals, arglist));
  /* ... */
  return res;
}
\end{minted}
    \caption{The original \Cn{} function}
    \label{fig:c}
\end{figure}

We chose to ignore some aspects of the original \Cn{} source code
during the formalisation.
For instance, the support for various locales and character encodings:
our interpreter only considers ASCII strings.
More importantly, the garbage collector of the reference interpreter
has not been translated.
We indeed consider that, as it is assumed not to change the final result,
its formalisation is not needed to prove the functional correctness
of \R{} programs.
For instance,
the \mintinline{C}{PROTECT} macro from Figure~\ref{fig:c}
temporarily disables the garbage collector:
it has thus been formalised out in Figure~\ref{fig:coq}.
% We believe theses change not to affect the usability of the formalisation.

Instead of defining such an interpreter,
we could have used already existing \Coq{} semantics
for \Cn{}~\parencite{formalin, Leroy-Compcert-CACM}
to directly define a semantics for \R{}.
But because of the abstraction layers of \Cn{},
proving properties about a given \R{} program
would then have been quite complex.
Furthermore, the \R{} reference interpreter has been built
with a strong intuition in mind~\parencite{ihaka1996r}.
It would have been lost if we attempted such a direct approach.
%
As a future work, it would be a very valuable contribution
to use these semantics to relate
our formal model to the source code of \R{}.
We furthermore believe that our line-to-line correspondance
would greatly help such a proof.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}{Coq}
Definition applyClosure S (op arglist rho : SExpRec_pointer)
    : result SExpRec_pointer :=
  read%defined rho_ := rho using S in
  ifb type rho_ <> EnvSxp then
    result_error S "'rho' must be an environment."
  else
    read%clo op_clo := op using S in
    let formals := clo_formals op_clo in
    let savedrho := clo_env op_clo in
    let%success actuals :=
      matchArgs S formals arglist using S in
    (* ... *)
    result_success S res.
\end{minted}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we presented a \Coq{} monadic interpreter
mimicking the behaviours of the \R{} reference interpreter.
We believe that our approach provides a high level of trust
for our formal semantics,
on which new projects about \R{} can be based---%
for instance,
to prove that a given \R{} program meets its specification.
We however think that the usability of this work can be improved.
We plan to make another formalisation
of \R{} proven correct with respect to the current one.
In essence, this new formalisation should
remove all the concepts of the current formalisation coming from \Cn{}:
the semantics of \R{} being mainly functional,
most usages of pointers could probably be removed.
% We also plan to test our formalisation.
% Adding non-core features is also planned.
